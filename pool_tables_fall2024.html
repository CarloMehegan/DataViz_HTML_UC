            <p>
                The "Table Number" column represents which table is being rented. This is only used for pool tables (1, 2, 3), but for our analysis we filled the empty cells with 4, 5, and 6 for Air Hockey, Foosball, and Shuffleboard, respectively. If the game was Pool but the table was unspecified, we filled the cell with 0. This was useful in separating the different types of rentals.

            <p>
                The figure above shows the different table games and how many rentals each game had over the semester. Pool has the majority, but we were surprised that it was not an even larger majority. Shuffleboard had the least rentals, but it was also surprising to us that our least popular table still had almost a hundred rentals.

            <p>
                There is not much difference between the three pool tables. This figure shows the distribution of rental duration for each table, and they all have nearly identical interquartile ranges. The median rental duration for all of the tables is approximately 40 minutes. The number of rentals for each table was as follows:
            </p>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Table Number</th>
                    <th>Number of Rentals</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Table 1</td>
                    <td>872</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Table 2</td>
                    <td>789</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Table 3</td>
                    <td>797</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Table number not recorded</td>
                    <td>22</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>
                Each table had roughly he same number of rentals. Table 1, the table closest to the attendant desk, has a bit more than the other two, and we suspect it is because of that proximity. The next three figures show the distribution of rental duration for Air Hockey, Foosball, and Shuffleboard.
            </p>

            <iframe src="resources/img/shuffleboard_duration_distribution.html" height="420" width="620"></iframe>


            <p>
                All three of the other table games have similar distributions to their rental durations. Rentals are typically between five to fifteen minutes long, with some rare, longer sessions. These rentals are much shorter on average than pool table rentals.
