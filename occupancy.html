            <p>
                Every 10-30 minutes, the Union Central attendant on shift takes a headcount of how many people are in the area and logs it. There were 2442 occupancy logs recorded between August 24, 2023, and December 19, 2023. Our analysis covers <b>2439</b> sanitized entries. The other entries were missing information and were removed during the data cleansing process. Below is an excerpt of the data.

            <p>
                For our occupancy analysis, we looked at the total occupancies across different days of the week in order to see how traffic through Union Central changed day to day.

            <p>
                In the figure above, we sum all of the headcounts by day of the week. Friday and Saturday see the most people. Friday's total occupancy is almost double that of the slowest day (Wednesday)'s total occupancy. We expected the weekends to be more popular than the weekdays. We are also open two hours later on Friday and Saturday, which contributes to why these two days have a higher total compared to the others.
