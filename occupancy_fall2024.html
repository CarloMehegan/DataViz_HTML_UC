            <p>
                For our occupancy analysis, we looked at the total occupancies across different days of the week in order to see how traffic through Union Central changed day to day.

            <p>
                In the figure above, we sum all of the headcounts by day of the week. Friday and Saturday see the most people. Friday's total occupancy is almost double that of the slowest day (Wednesday)'s total occupancy. We expected the weekends to be more popular than the weekdays. We are also open two hours later on Friday and Saturday, which contributes to why these two days have a higher total compared to the others.

                This figure splits the data further into months. Plotly allows you to double-click on a category in the legend to isolate it, which helps for understanding this plot. We see that September contributes the most to the overall total occupancy, followed by October. One reason December and August are lower is because Union Central was not open for the entire month. With that in mind, December contributes a fair amount to the overall occupancy, being comparable to October and November in some cases. However, this could be because of Fall Break and Thanksgiving Break, which led to closures during those months as well. September contributes the most overall because it is near the beginning of the semester and it is the only month with no academic breaks. The September-Friday bar is so high because Friday is the busiest weekday and there were five Fridays in September 2023, an explanation which took us a bit of time to figure out.
