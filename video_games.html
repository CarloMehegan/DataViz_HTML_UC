            <p>
                It is important to note that the Playstation 5 was out of commission during the Fall 2023 semester. There was a single "rental" on December 8, when someone brought in their own console to connect to the game station, and rented extra controllers. We can see this outlier in the duration graph below.
            </p>

            <iframe src="./resources/img/video_duration_by_console.html" height="440" width="680"></iframe>
            
            <p>
                The figure above shows the distribution of rental durations grouped by console. There were 217 Wii U rentals and 177 Xbox One rentals, making the Wii the most popular console. However, Wii rentals tend to be shorter on average than Xbox rentals. We suspect this is because of the type of games offered on each console.
            </p>

            <iframe src="./resources/img/games_pie_chart_divided.html" height="550" width="864"></iframe>


            <p>
                These pie charts show how many rentals each individual title had. The "Other" category combines games that had less than five rentals. The "Unspecified" category contains rentals that were missing the game title, but that we still wanted to include in our overall analysis. This happens often, seemingly because attendants forget to record the game name while handing out the disc and all of the controllers required for the video game rental, or possibly because attendants hand renters the entire video game disc folder for perusal and forget to note which game they chose.
                <br><br>
                The Wii's most popular title is Mario Kart, taking almost half of its rentals. We suspected Mario Kart was the most popular game, but we are surprised it didn't take a larger majority. The rentals on the Xbox are a bit more spread out across a few main titles.
                <br><br>
                This second figure may explain why rental durations are longer on the Xbox than on the Wii. Games such as Mario Kart and Wii Sports typically have shorter rounds of play, while games like Madden, FIFA, and Call of Duty have longer matches.
            </p>

            <iframe src="./resources/img/controller_by_top_game.html" height="440" width="680"></iframe>

            <p>
                This final graph shows the top five games previously mentioned and how many controllers are rented in relation to each game. Here we see that two-player sessions are the most common for all of these games, and Mario Kart is the most popular game for groups.
                <br><br>
                It is also worth noting that all five of these games are multiplayer-centric experiences. The controller data shows that Union Central most often caters to people in groups, a fact that is not captured by any other rental data.
